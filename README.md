## Abstract:
In this problem we worked on a set of mixed audio recordings which have been created using instantaneous mixing. The audio file contains two channels. Two Python scripts are included:
<ol type="I">
  <li>Main script, loading the audio files and calling the ICA function</li>
  <li>ICA function definition and model's weights update implementation</li>
</ol>

## Data
The employed scripts have been primarily developed by the course staff. The students were called to individually complete a few significant lines of code as a last step, in order to apply the formulas discussed in class.

## Goal
The Exercise belongs to week 8 class, focused on dictionary learning and source separation. Specifically, several dictionary learning-based algorithms have been discussed, while only Independent Component Analysis has been applied. The objective of the exercise has been to understand the derivation behind ICA, and apply ICA as a source separation technique. The course provided us students with knowledge of: 1) Fundamental and widely applied signal processing methods. 2) Matlab or Python as a tool for the development of signal processing algorithms. 3) how to derive and construct a modern signal processing system based on machine learning.

## Usage
The suggested means of usage of the provided material is by reading through the main Python ex8_5.py script. By loading the mixture_instantaneous.wav audio file, two audio files (ica_source_1.wav and ica_source_2.wav) are being returned, demonstrating how ICA model is effective within separation of sources that are statistically independent.

## Conclusion
Machine learning is becoming an indispensable tool for communication engineers. However, as the field of machine learning is broad, identifying a set of relevant tools for solving a specific set of problems may be challenging. <br/><br/> Specifically for this assignment, linear and nonlinear adaptive equalizer models have been implemented. Moreover, it has been successfully shown how a signal - distorted by such modeled systems - can be restored by resorting on machine learning algorithms (e.g. gradient descent).
